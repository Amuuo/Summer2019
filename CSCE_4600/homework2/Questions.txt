Once the one incrementing iteration is complete, the semaphore is released, and the next process in queue enteres to perform the same task, locking the semaphore behind it. This repeats until variable N reaches 500, from 1;

As seen from the output, the processess are perfectly syncronized: 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, ...
